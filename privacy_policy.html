Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how [Your Company / App Name] collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use our application that integrates with Instagram (Meta) using the Instagram Graph API and Webhooks. By using our app or granting access via Instagram/Facebook, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.
1. Summary / Key Points
    • We collect information you provide and information we receive from Instagram (Meta) via the Graph API and Webhooks, only as needed to operate the app.
    • We use data to provide, maintain, and improve the app (including receiving webhook events and posting or reading permitted content).
    • We do not sell personal information.
    • You control many permissions through your Instagram/Facebook settings and can revoke access at any time.
    • For specific legal rights (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) see the “Your Rights” section below.
2. Information We Collect
2.1 Information you provide directly:
- Account/profile details you enter into the app (display name, contact email, business details).
- Content you upload to our app (images, captions, files) if you use app features that store media.
- Support requests and communications (emails, messages you send to us).
2.2 Information we receive from Instagram / Meta:
When you connect your Instagram account to our app and grant permissions, Meta may share certain data with us via the Instagram Graph API and Webhooks. The exact items depend on the permissions/scopes you grant and may include:
- Basic account info (username, account ID, profile metadata).
- Media and media metadata (images, videos, captions, timestamps) for accounts you authorize.
- Comments, likes, and engagement metadata for media where permitted.
- Insights and analytics data if the permission is granted.
- Webhook events for subscribed objects (e.g., media, comments, messages) where you have authorized such notifications.
Note: The precise fields we receive are determined by the Instagram/Meta APIs and the permissions you approve. We only request and store the minimum scopes needed to provide app functionality.
2.3 Automated and technical data:
- Log data (IP addresses, timestamps, request and error logs).
- Device and usage data (browser type, operating system, pages or features used).
- Cookies and similar technologies (see Cookies section).
3. How We Use Your Information
We use data for purposes including:
- To operate, maintain and provide the features of the app (including posting, reading, and managing media and comments as permitted).
- To receive and process webhook events from Instagram/Meta (e.g., new media, comment notifications).
- To authenticate and validate accounts and access tokens.
- To communicate with you (support, account notices, updates).
- To analyze and improve the app, debug issues, and monitor performance and security.
- To comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.
We will not use your Instagram content in ways beyond the scope you agreed to, unless we obtain additional consent.
4. Legal Bases for Processing (where applicable)
    • Contractual necessity: To perform the app services you requested (e.g., manage media, deliver webhook events).
    • Legitimate interests: For app security, debugging, analytics, and to prevent abuse (we balance these interests against your privacy).
    • Consent: Where required (e.g., optional features requiring explicit consent).
    • Legal compliance: To respond to legal requests.
5. Sharing and Disclosure of Information
We may disclose personal information:
- With Meta/Instagram as required by API interactions (data flows between our servers and Meta as part of API calls and webhooks).
- To service providers and subprocessors that perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, email, storage). They are contractually required to protect data and only process for permitted purposes.
- To comply with laws or respond to lawful requests (e.g., subpoenas, court orders).
- To protect rights and safety: in urgent cases (fraud, security, threats).
- In connection with a business transaction (sale, merger, or acquisition) — we will notify users and apply protections in accordance with applicable law.
We do not sell personal information.
6. Third-Party Services and Links
    • Our app uses third-party services (cloud hosts, analytics, monitoring, etc.). Those providers may collect and process data on our behalf — see their privacy policies for details.
    • The app may link to third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those sites; we recommend reviewing their policies.
7. Webhooks & Access Tokens
    • We use webhooks to receive near real-time notifications from Instagram/Meta for subscribed events (e.g., new media, comments). Webhook payloads may contain identifiers and metadata related to the event.
    • Access tokens issued by Meta are used to perform API actions on your behalf. We store access tokens securely and limit access to authorized processes only.
    • You can revoke our app’s access through your Instagram/Facebook account settings which will stop webhooks and API access.
8. Data Retention
    • We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the services or to comply with legal obligations.
    • Typical retention periods (examples — customize as needed):
    • Account/profile data: retained while your account exists + up to 12 months after account deletion for backup / legal reasons.
    • Webhook/event logs: retained for up to 90 days for debugging and security monitoring.
    • Support communications: retained for up to 24 months.
    • If you request deletion, we will remove data from active systems within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal and backup retention requirements.
9. Security
    • We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data (access controls, encryption in transit, secure storage).
    • No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    • If a data breach affecting personal data is discovered, we will comply with applicable breach notification laws and notify affected users as required.
10. International Data Transfers
Our systems and subprocessors may be located in multiple countries. Personal information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in countries outside your jurisdiction. Where required by law, we will implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to protect your data.
11. Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights, including to:
- Access the personal data we hold about you.
- Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Request deletion of your personal data.
- Object to or restrict certain processing.
- Request portability of your personal data.
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
To exercise these rights, contact us at [Contact Email]. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.
For Instagram/Facebook-specific controls:
- You can revoke app permissions at any time from your Instagram/Facebook account settings → Business Integrations / Apps and Websites.
- You can delete content directly in Instagram, and removing or disconnecting your account will limit the data we receive in future.
12. Children's Privacy
Our app is not directed to children under the age of [13/16 — choose applicable threshold]. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, contact us and we will promptly delete it.
13. Cookies & Tracking Technologies
We and our third-party partners may use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to improve functionality, analyze usage, and store preferences. You can control cookies via your browser settings. Disabling cookies may limit certain features.
14. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy with a new “Last updated” date. For material changes, we will provide more prominent notice (e.g., email notification or in-app notice) where required by law.
15. Data Protection Addendum & Subprocessors
If you are a business customer with specific compliance needs (e.g., data processing addendum, export controls), contact us at [Contact Email]. We can provide details about subprocessors and contractual safeguards (e.g., SCCs) on request.
